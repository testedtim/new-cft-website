summary: Code for Tucson is a Code for America Brigade located in Tucson,
  Arizona. Founded in 2014, we are a a non-partisan, non-political group of
  volunteer civic hackers working together to solve local issues and help people
  engage with the city. We host twice-monthly hacknights and other events to
  gather, discuss, and get stuff done. We're looking to bring people with all
  different skill sets together to maximize our potential. Civic hackers aren't
  just developersâ€”they're journalists, lawyers, designers, and interested
  citizens in general. The more community participation, the better. Learn more
  about the CfA Brigade program here.
