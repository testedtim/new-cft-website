      Come to a meetup. We host virtual project nights twice a month to discuss
      projects, collaborate, and learn from each other. We post events and
      manage RSVPs through our Meetup group (hosted through Meetup.com). Join
      Meetup to get notified when we announce a new event. Newcomers welcome,
      regardless of technical ability.
