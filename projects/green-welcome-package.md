\
Tucson is a desert experiencing drought exacerbated by the climate crisis. If we did enough rainwater harvesting, we could address much of the water shortage.\
\
So we’re creating a website that shares the joys of living in Tucson and how to acclimate and thrive in our desert town - including sustainable living idea like rainwater harvesting. See the website in progress: Welcome Package Website.\
\
What we need:\
Coders? Designers? Content writers?\
