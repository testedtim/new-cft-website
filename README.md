- [x] Cleanup directories
- [x] Homepage
- [x] Projects
- [x] Get involved
- [x] Update project posts
- [x] About page
- [x] Code of conduct

## Background
A new code repository for the Code for Tucson Website.

## Contributing
If you're new to coding, we recommend installing:
- a text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) which is a version control system. This helps people collaborate on projects. If you're new to git, take a look a [Github Git tutorial](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

Feel free to dive in! [Open an issue](https://github.com/CodeForTucson/new-cft-website/issues/new), submit Pull Requests (PRs), or even start your own project!

If you'd like to get your feet wet, take a look at some [good first issues](https://github.com/CodeForTucson/new-cft-website/labels/good%20first%20issue).

### Brief Tutorial
We recommend newcomers to first read an old [guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/). However, the developer community recently agreed to rename the `master` branch to `main`. 
As a refresher, to contribute, take the following steps:

- First, `clone` the repo
```
git clone <repo_url>
```

If you are not added yet as a collaborator, you may first need to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repo in order to contribute.

- Create a new `branch` from the [main](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches) branch (or `master`, or whatever branch you want to work off of).
```
git checkout -b <your_new_branch_name>
```

- Make some code edits in your code editor. Then `stage` your changes with:
```
git add <the_file_you_modified>
```

- Then you need to `commit` your changes with a message
```
git commit -m 'A brief summary of your code'
```

- Push your changes to the remote repo (hosted here on Github):
```
git push -u origin <your_new_branch_name>
```

- Finally, on Github, create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) if you don't have write access to the repository.

## Learning Resources
### Websites
- Front-end development. Most coders find it easiest to start with front-end development. This is how to code how a website looks and feels like. Languages to start with are
	- [HTML, CSS, Javascript: Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
	- [HTML, CSS, Javascript: W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
	- [JamStack](https://jamstack.org/) - a modern, more sophisticated way of building websites and apps, once you know HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Back-end development. This often involves working with data and logic to do something useful. Some common, beginner-friendly languages are:
	- [NodeJS](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/)
	- [Python](https://www.learnpython.org/)
	- [PHP](https://www.w3schools.com/php/)
	- [C#](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php)
	- [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/) has different variants like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc. They all very similar so just pick one.
		- [MySQL](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/)
		- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/)
		- [SQL Server](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/)
- Mobile development.
	- [Android](https://developer.android.com/)
	- [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training)
	- Multi-platform allows you to write apps that work on both Android and Apple devices with one codebase.
		- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
		- [ReactNative](https://reactnative.dev/)
		- [Nativescript](https://nativescript.org/)
- Analytics. For machine learning, data analysis, and automation, Python is the way to go. 
	- [Python](https://www.learnpython.org/)
	- [Data Analysis](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/)
	- Machine Learning
		- [Basics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
		- [Deep Learning](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/#tensorflow)
- User Interfaces and User Experience (UI/UX):
	- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
	- [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)
- Devops optimizes how people develop code
	- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
	- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/)
	- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
